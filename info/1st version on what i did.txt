I am building a website for automation of clinic management. I have named it Nepals care. 

So I know following tech stack to do this project:
1) Django, DRF ..... other Django framework
2) Tailwind CSS
3) Java script
4) good with Python and could adapt with any new library and framework coming on way

Yet i have completed 60-70% of frontend work where i have just made UI using Html tailwind & JS, and used array to store dummy data and made the page info render from js dynamically. Also made the project & app in Django with configuring the views, url that takes to particular page. I know Django well.

So my main or must to have work or plan on this project is to do following:
1) Appointment booking get time, ticket etc..
2) Video Consulting or so called online session
3) Medicine Management system
4) Doctor, Patient & Admin management system


The main problem with this project is i just went with flow of coding, never planed to add this or not to add or any other this made me harder. so I dont want to repeat same thing while doing backend so i want to make it all clear and make the project work go smooth


So I want to do all head-burn, brainstorming and other in this step, so i want your help to do so. Like logic building and other. Also IF some of frontend need to be changed updated or removed or added Plz make a proper analysis
